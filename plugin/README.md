# User specific modal choice plugins for Nodus

“BoxCox1.java” and “BoxCox2.java” (GPLv3 license, using Nodus API) are two user-defined modal choice 
plugins. Once compiled 
([JDK version 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 
or above must be installed on your computer) using the provided 
"compile.sh" or "compile.bat" script, the .jar file(s) can be dropped in your Nodus project 
directory. The corresponding modal choice model(s) will then appear among 
the available possibilities in the “multi-flow” assignment tab. Note that 
precompiled .jar files are also provided.
